If you try enough cases, build enough businesses, coach enough young people, and sit with
enough families in hard moments, you begin to see patterns.

Not just in the law. In life.

I have been blessed with strong mentors, serious training, and rooms where the stakes were high. I studied hard. I competed. I tried cases. I built companies. But if I’m honest, the greatest lessons did not come from victories. They came from responsibility to learn from my failures and the failures of others.

The courtroom may humble you. Business will expose you. Mentorship will refine you.

Over time, I learned that clients do not come to you for noise. They come for clarity. They come
for steadiness. They come for someone who can see around corners and tell them the truth
without panic. The law is not about theatrics. It is about positioning. It is about understanding
risk, leverage, timing, and human nature.

And it is about service.

Somewhere along the way, I realized that knowledge hoarded is power wasted. That realization
pushed me toward building tools and platforms that empower people to understand their rights
and make informed decisions. Access should not belong only to the wealthy or the well-
connected. Structure, guidance, and strategy can—and should—be shared.

I have also learned this: integrity compounds. So does reputation. Guard both carefully. In our
profession, your name travels into rooms before you do. Make sure it carries weight for the right
reasons.

Coaching young people taught me another truth. Leadership is not loud. It is consistent. It shows up early. It stays late. It holds standards without humiliation. It corrects without diminishing. It sees potential and calls it forward.
Life has a way of testing you across different arenas—education, litigation, business, family.
Each arena asks the same question in a different form: Who are you when it matters?

I do not claim perfection. I claim growth. I claim effort. I claim a commitment to turning
negatives into strategic positives and uncertainty into structure.

If Herrerake stands for anything, let it stand for this:
Do the work. Tell the truth. Protect your name with good character. Serve people well.

Everything else follows.
