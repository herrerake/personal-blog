## From General AI to Skilled AI

I’ve been pair-programming with AI agents for a while now.

They’re good.
Fast.
Confident.

But here’s the truth.

They’ve read the internet. They’ve seen the docs. They can generate solid code.

But general knowledge is noisy.
And agents are still susceptible to mistakes.

What they _don’t_ know by default is this:

There are official skills, written by the people who know the technology best, that encode how the framework is actually meant to be used.

Production guidance, edge cases, and the stuff you normally learn the hard way.

Once I realized that existed, the mental model shifted.

Instead of Claude Code reasoning from broad internet knowledge…

It can now reference skills distilled by the creators themselves.

It’s the difference between guessing and following the playbook.

Very Morpheus in _The Matrix_.

You don’t “figure out” kung fu.

You download it.

And suddenly the agent isn’t trying to infer best practices from scattered documentation.

It’s operating with the same production guidance the maintainers use.

No more pasting doc URLs. The best practices are already installed.

## The Tweet That Sent Me Down This Path

When Matt Silverlock ([@elithrar](https://x.com/elithrar/status/2022284368136540234?s=46&t=O6kPFlgthaK5642UlvOsBQ)) announced that **Cloudflare published an official Workers skill** built from the same guidance they give customers and their own teams when shipping Workers to production, I immediately stopped scrolling.

I opened my laptop.

Because I ship to production.

And if Cloudflare distilled their production guidance into a machine-readable skill, I want in on that.

That’s when it clicked:

> Why am I letting my coding agent guess how Workers should be written?

I don’t want it improvising from generalized knowledge.

I want it operating from Cloudflare’s production playbook.

So `npx skills add cloudflare/skills` I went.

Then it turns out nearly every major piece of my stack has an official skill:

- Astro
- Cloudflare
- Wrangler
- Tailwind
- Frontend design
- UI/UX

This wasn’t a niche experiment.

This was ecosystem-level alignment.

So I installed them all.

And then curiosity took over.

If these official, production-grade skills are now wired into my repo…

What happens if I run a full audit?

So I opened Claude Code and prompted:

> Now with these skills in place, let’s run an audit of this repo.

No roadmap.
No grand strategy.

Just curiosity.

That’s when things got interesting.

## What Are “Skills”?

If you’re new to this concept, start here:

- https://skills.sh/
- https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/skills

At a high level:

- Skills are structured `SKILLS.md` files
- They encode framework conventions and best practices
- Agents read them before generating or reviewing code

Think of them as:

> Institutional knowledge, but machine-readable.

Instead of:

> Write a Cloudflare Worker

You get:

> Write a Cloudflare Worker the way this stack expects it to be written in production.

Installation is simple:

```bash
npx skills add
```

You can install globally or per project.

I installed some directly into my blog repo and some globally.

The agent now operates with project-specific context instead of generalized training data.

## The Audit

Instead of one pass, I reviewed the repo through multiple lenses:

- Astro
- Cloudflare
- Accessibility
- Design
- Runtime configuration

Then I consolidated the findings.

The result:

- **11 critical issues**
- **25 warnings**
- **15 improvement suggestions**

And this is a personal blog.

If you think your production SaaS marketing site doesn’t have hidden issues, it does.

## What We Found (And Fixed)

### 1. Dead Components

Components sitting in the repo that nothing referenced anymore.

Old layouts.  
Unused UI.  
Artifacts from experimentation.

Not catastrophic.

But unnecessary complexity compounds.

Deleted.

### 2. Missing `<!doctype html>`

Five pages were missing a proper `<!doctype html>` declaration.

That can trigger quirks mode in browsers.

You won’t notice until something behaves strangely.

Fixed in seconds.

### 3. Runtime Secrets Using `import.meta.env`

This one sounds scarier than it was.

I originally had:

```ts
REALTIME_SPORTS_API_KEY: import.meta.env.REALTIME_SPORTS_API_KEY ??
  context.locals?.runtime?.env?.REALTIME_SPORTS_API_KEY;
```

Here's the issue:

`import.meta.env` values get inlined at build time.

If a secret exists during CI and your build references it, the value can be embedded into the compiled Worker bundle as a string literal.

On Cloudflare Workers, that means:

- The secret could be baked into the deployed \_worker.js
- It becomes part of the build artifact
- It’s no longer strictly runtime only

Now, this code runs server-side on Workers, not in the browser, so it wasn’t automatically exposed in client-side JavaScript.

Embedding secrets into build artifacts introduces unnecessary risk.

Secrets should be runtime only.

The correct pattern is to rely on runtime bindings:

```ts
context.locals.runtime.env;
```

That pulls from Cloudflare’s encrypted environment bindings at request time, without compiling the value into the bundle.

This wasn’t a “we’ve been hacked” moment.

It was a “we’re professionals fix it properly” moment.

And that’s the standard I want my projects held to.

### 4. Accessibility Gaps

We were missing:

- `:focus-visible` states
- `prefers-reduced-motion` support

That means:

- Keyboard users get poor feedback
- Motion-sensitive users get forced animations

This is the difference between "looks good" and "production-grade."

Now the site respects user settings.

### 5. Deprecated Astro API

Astro's `ViewTransitions` API had been replaced by `ClientRouter`.

No errors yet.

But deprecated means future breakage.

Upgraded proactively.

## The Bigger Shift

The audit took minutes.

Fixing everything took under an hour.

If I had done this manually, it would've taken half a day and I would have missed something. And not just a semicolon.

Before:

> I had a general-purpose AI assistant.

Now:

> I have a stack-aware teammate with institutional and tribal knowledge.

That's the shift.

Skills turn an agent from "smart autocomplete" into production leverage.

And this is where it gets interesting.

You can write your own skills.

You can encode:

- Your design system rules
- Your CMS conventions
- Your translation glossary
- Your deployment policies
- Your accessibility standards
- Your security guardrails

Every agent you spin up inherits that brain.

This is what AI-native marketing engineering starts to look like. Not prompts, but encoded systems.

We're not just asking better questions.

We're building reusable intelligence into our workflows.

The teams that treat AI like autocomplete will move incrementally.

The teams that encode their playbook into skills will move exponentially.

If you're shipping to production and your agent doesn't know your stack…

Teach it.

Then let it audit you.
