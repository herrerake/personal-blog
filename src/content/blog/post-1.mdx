## Lets start with a brief history.

Growing up in a household where English was seldom spoken, I found myself immersed in a beautiful blend of cultures.
While my friends were relishing pizzas and pop tarts, our home has sancocho, aguacate y chicarron,
and the rhythm of salsa. School and the neighborhood gifted me with the quintessential '90s childhood experience.
From a young age I cerished the fact I had this dual cultural identity.

## Accomplishments and Pivotal Moments

### Embracing Change: From Law to Code

Post-undergrad, I embarked on a different journey than expected. I studied History and Economics with dreams of Law School. One summer studying the LSAT and working as a paralegal was enough to know that this was not it.

Enter General Assembly's Web Dev Immersive program, a 3 month coding bootcamp. I took a 20k bet on software engineering over 200k on a law degree.

That pivot changed my life.

### Beyond the Code: Pursuits and Passions

Beyond lines of code, I find solace and joy in various pursuits. Turns out writing as voluntarily as an adult is way better than forced as a kid.

Yoga makes the space slightly above the space between my eyes tingle. Sports keep the boy in me alive. And in nature is where I go get lost.

I'm an avid reader, or should I say listener. I mostly read Reddit and blogs, but I do keep a book around. But mostly I listen to books these days.

My faith grounds me. I give all the glory to God as without Him none of this would have been possible. Thats first and foremost.

Lastly, I'm a big board games, card games, puzzles kinda guy.

## Sharing My Journey

### Why I Share

Get comfortable being uncomfortable. And one day I want to look back at all the stupid stuff I written. One day hopefully im not half bad at this writing thing.
