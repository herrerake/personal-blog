## It's Here nor There

I’m a dual citizen of the United States and Colombia.
For most of my life, I’ve felt slightly out of place no matter where I am. In the U.S., I’m Colombian enough for it to matter. In Colombia, I’m American enough for it to show. It’s not dramatic, just a constant awareness that I don’t fully belong in either place.
Software engineering wasn’t a calling. It was a practical decision. I liked building things, I liked systems, and I wanted leverage over my time and location. Remote work wasn’t about freedom at first it was about options. It was a bet on my future.
Over time, those options started to matter more than I expected.
Working remotely from Colombia with my family failing, but trying, to keep quiet while I'm on a Zoom call did something subtle to me. Afterall, what's more important than family.
But it's not always what you bargain for. Some days it’s inconvenient. Some days it’s lonely. Some days I wonder if I’m avoiding something instead of choosing something.

This blog is me trying to make sense of that alignment.
It’s about tech, remote work, identity, and the tension between building a career and building a life that actually feels like mine. I don’t have a clean thesis yet. I’m writing to figure it out.
This is the beginning.
