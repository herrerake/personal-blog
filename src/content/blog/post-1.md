# Allow me to reintroduce myself

## Lets start with a brief history.

Growing up in a household where English was seldom spoken, I found myself immersed in a beautiful blend of cultures. While my friends were relishing pizzas and pop tunes, our home resonated with the aroma of arepas, the zest of chicarron, and the rhythm of salsa. School and the neighborhood gifted me with the quintessential '90s childhood experience. It was a delicate dance between the cultural tapestry of my home and the vibrant world outside.

## Accomplishments and Pivotal Moments

### Embracing Change: From Law to Code

Post-undergrad, I embarked on a different journey than expected. Law school, though a common choice, didn't resonate with me. Enter software engineering—a pivot that aligned with my longing for a life that mirrored the duality I cherished. The dream to work remotely, perpetuating the fusion of my dual cultural upbringing, became my guiding star.

### Beyond the Code: Pursuits and Passions

Beyond lines of code, I find solace and joy in various pursuits. Writing is my sanctuary, a place where thoughts find their voice. Yoga grounds me, sports keep me lively, and nature beckons me to explore its wonders. I'm an avid reader, especially drawn to self-help and spiritual literature. My faith grounds me, and spirituality is a realm I'm deeply engaged in. Oh, and board games and puzzles? They light up my social gatherings with friends.

## Sharing My Journey

### Why I Share

This blog isn't just a space for tales and musings—it's a canvas where I blend my writing prowess and engineering finesse. One day, I'll glance back at this digital memoir and reminisce with a smile. And perhaps, in sharing my journey, someone else may find a glimmer of enjoyment or inspiration along the way.

## What's next

Stay tuned as I attempt to write everything down!
