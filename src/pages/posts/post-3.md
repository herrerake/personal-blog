# Allow me to reintroduce myself

Published on: 2023-12-11

Lets start with a brief history.

## Yearning for identity

As a dual citizen of the United States and Colombia, my quest to become a software engineer while relishing the freedom of remote work has been a captivating journey. It's more than a career path; it's a fusion of my aspirations and heritage.

For a multicultural person like me, straddling between two worlds often sparks a sense of not fully belonging here or there. Yet, it's in this duality that I find a unique kind of richness—a richness in experiencing the vibrant colors of both Colombia and the United States.

My dream of working remotely from Colombia, the land where my parents have woven the tapestry of our family history, has been my beacon. Cartagena, with its enchanting streets and the warm embrace of my roots, beckons me often.

The allure of remote work goes beyond flexibility; it's a doorway to embrace my dual identity fully. It allows me to soak up the sights and sounds of Cartagena, to feel at home while crafting code that transcends borders and cultures.

Every moment spent remotely working has added depth and flavor to my life, painting a canvas where my passions, heritage, and career converge harmoniously.

Join me on this journey as I navigate the terrains of software engineering and the intricacies of being a dual citizen—a blend of cultures, aspirations, and the unwavering pursuit of a fulfilling life.

This is just the beginning—the beginning of a story where remote work, dual citizenship, and a love for Cartagena intertwine to create a vibrant narrative of self-discovery and growth.
